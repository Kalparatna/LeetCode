# LeetCode Problem 60: Permutation Sequence

## Problem Description

The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

```
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
```

Given two integers `n` and `k`, your task is to return the k-th permutation sequence in lexicographic order.

### Example 1:
**Input:**
```
n = 3, k = 3
```
**Output:**
```
"213"
```

### Example 2:
**Input:**
```
n = 4, k = 9
```
**Output:**
```
"2314"
```

### Example 3:
**Input:**
```
n = 3, k = 1
```
**Output:**
```
"123"
```

## Solution Approach

This problem can be solved using Pythonâ€™s `itertools.permutations` method, which generates all permutations of a given sequence in lexicographic order. The key steps involve:

1. Generate a list of numbers from `1` to `n`.
2. Use `itertools.permutations` to generate all possible permutations.
3. Convert each tuple of digits into a string.
4. Return the k-th permutation (accounting for 0-based indexing).

### Python Implementation

```python
import itertools

class Solution:
    def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:
        numbers = []
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            numbers.append(str(i))

        permutations = list(itertools.permutations(numbers))
        permutations = [''.join(p) for p in permutations]
        return permutations[k - 1]

```
