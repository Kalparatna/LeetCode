# Add Binary Strings

This project provides a solution to add two binary strings and return their sum as a binary string. It uses a simple algorithm that handles binary addition, including carrying over when the sum of two digits exceeds 1.

## Example 1
- **Input:** `a = "11"`, `b = "1"`
- **Output:** `"100"`

## Example 2
- **Input:** `a = "1010"`, `b = "1011"`
- **Output:** `"10101"`

## Constraints
- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- `a` and `b` consist only of '0' or '1' characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.

## Solution

The solution involves the following steps:

1. **Normalize Length:** Pad the shorter string with leading zeros so that both strings are of the same length.
2. **Initialize Result and Carry:** Prepare to collect the result and manage the carry-over during addition.
3. **Iterate from Right to Left:** Add corresponding digits from both strings, managing the carry and building the result.
4. **Handle Final Carry:** If there is a carry left after the final addition, append it to the result.
5. **Reverse and Join:** The result is built in reverse order, so reverse it back and join to form the final binary string.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        # Step 1: Make both strings the same length by adding leading zeros to the shorter one
        max_len = max(len(a), len(b))
        a = a.zfill(max_len)
        b = b.zfill(max_len)
        
        result = []
        carry = 0
        
        for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):
            total = carry
            total += int(a[i])
            total += int(b[i])
            
            digit = total % 2  # Compute the binary digit to add to the result
            carry = total // 2  # Compute the carry for the next iteration

            result.append(str(digit))

        if carry != 0:
            result.append('1')

        result.reverse()
        
        return ''.join(result)
```

### Detailed Steps

1. **Normalization of Length:**
   - Use `zfill` to add leading zeros to the shorter string. This ensures that both strings have the same length, simplifying the addition process.

2. **Addition and Carry Management:**
   - Start from the least significant bit (rightmost). For each pair of bits (including any carry from the previous addition), compute the sum. 
   - Determine the resulting bit (either 0 or 1) and the carry (either 0 or 1) to be used in the next addition.

3. **Final Carry Handling:**
   - After processing all bits, if there is a remaining carry, append it to the result.

4. **Reverse and Combine:**
   - Since the result is built from the least significant bit to the most significant bit, it needs to be reversed before joining into a final string.

This approach ensures the solution is efficient and handles large binary numbers up to the specified constraint.
