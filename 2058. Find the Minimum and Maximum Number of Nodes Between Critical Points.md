# Nodes Between Critical Points

## Problem Description

A critical point in a linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima. A node is a local maxima if the current node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node. A node is a local minima if the current node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node. Note that a node can only be a local maxima/minima if there exists both a previous node and a next node.

Given a linked list `head`, return an array of length 2 containing `[minDistance, maxDistance]` where `minDistance` is the minimum distance between any two distinct critical points and `maxDistance` is the maximum distance between any two distinct critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `head = [3,1]`

**Output:** `[-1,-1]`

**Explanation:** There are no critical points in `[3,1]`.

#### Example 2

**Input:** `head = [5,3,1,2,5,1,2]`

**Output:** `[1,3]`

**Explanation:** There are three critical points:
- The third node is a local minima because 1 is less than 3 and 2.
- The fifth node is a local maxima because 5 is greater than 2 and 1.
- The sixth node is a local minima because 1 is less than 5 and 2.
  The minimum distance is between the fifth and the sixth node: `6 - 5 = 1`.
  The maximum distance is between the third and the sixth node: `6 - 3 = 3`.

#### Example 3

**Input:** `head = [1,3,2,2,3,2,2,2,7]`

**Output:** `[3,3]`

**Explanation:** There are two critical points:
- The second node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 1 and 2.
- The fifth node is a local maxima because 3 is greater than 2 and 2.
  Both the minimum and maximum distances are between the second and the fifth node: `5 - 2 = 3`.

## Solution

The solution involves iterating through the linked list and identifying the indices of critical points. Then, we calculate the minimum and maximum distances between these critical points.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a list `cp` to store the indices of critical points.
2. Iterate through the linked list, starting from the second node and ending at the second to last node:
    - Check if the current node is a local maxima or minima by comparing it with the previous and next nodes.
    - If it is, add the index to the `cp` list.
3. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.
4. Calculate the minimum and maximum distances between the critical points:
    - The maximum distance is the difference between the first and the last critical points.
    - The minimum distance is the smallest difference between any two consecutive critical points.

### Solution Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(self, head: ListNode) -> List[int]:
        if not head or not head.next or not head.next.next:
            return [-1, -1]

        cp = []
        ind = 0
        previous, current, next_node = head, head.next, head.next.next

        while next_node:
            if (current.val > previous.val and current.val > next_node.val) or (current.val < previous.val and current.val < next_node.val):
                cp.append(ind + 1)

            previous = current
            current = next_node
            next_node = next_node.next
            ind += 1

        if len(cp) < 2:
            return [-1,-1]
        
        min_dist = float('inf')
        max_dist = cp[-1] - cp[0]

        for i in range(1, len(cp)):
            min_dist = min(min_dist, cp[i] - cp[i-1])

        return [min_dist, max_dist]
