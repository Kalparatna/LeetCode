# Sqrt(x)

## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return the square root of `x` rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator. For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in C++ or `x ** 0.5` in Python.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `x = 4`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

#### Example 2

**Input:** `x = 8`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.

## Solution

To solve this problem without using built-in exponent functions, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to find the square root by searching for the integer `k` such that `k * k` is less than or equal to `x`, but `(k + 1) * k` is greater than `x`.

### Approach

1. **Base Case:** If `x` is 0 or 1, return `x` itself since the square root of 0 is 0 and the square root of 1 is 1.
2. **Binary Search:** Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to 0 and `x` respectively. Perform binary search:
    - Compute the middle point `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`.
    - If `mid * mid` is equal to `x`, return `mid`.
    - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1`.
    - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1`.
3. **Result:** The variable `right` will hold the integer part of the square root of `x` after the loop terminates.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x == 0 or x == 1:
            return x
        
        left, right = 0, x
        
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if mid * mid == x:
                return mid
            elif mid * mid < x:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        
        return right
```

### Explanation

- We first handle the base cases where `x` is 0 or 1.
- We then initialize the `left` and `right` pointers for binary search.
- In the binary search loop, we calculate the middle point `mid` and compare `mid * mid` with `x`.
- Based on the comparison, we adjust the `left` and `right` pointers.
- After the loop terminates, `right` will contain the largest integer `k` such that `k * k` is less than or equal to `x`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(log x) because we are performing binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.
