# Merge Nodes in Between Zeros

## Problem Description

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers separated by 0's. The beginning and end of the linked list will have `Node.val == 0`.

For every two consecutive 0's, merge all the nodes lying in between them into a single node whose value is the sum of all the merged nodes. The modified list should not contain any 0's.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `head = [0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]`

**Output:** `[4,11]`

**Explanation:**
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 3 + 1 = 4.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 4 + 5 + 2 = 11.

#### Example 2

**Input:** `head = [0,1,0,3,0,2,2,0]`

**Output:** `[1,3,4]`

**Explanation:**
- The sum of the nodes marked in green: 1 = 1.
- The sum of the nodes marked in red: 3 = 3.
- The sum of the nodes marked in yellow: 2 + 2 = 4.

## Solution

The solution involves iterating through the linked list and summing the values of the nodes between each pair of zeros. When a zero is encountered, the sum is added as a new node to the result linked list if the sum is not zero. This process is repeated until the end of the list is reached.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a dummy node to serve as the head of the result list.
2. Initialize a pointer `current` to point to the dummy node.
3. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of node values between zeros.
4. Iterate through the linked list starting from the node after the initial zero:
    - If a zero is encountered and the sum is not zero, create a new node with the sum and add it to the result list. Reset the sum to zero.
    - If a non-zero node is encountered, add its value to the sum.
5. Continue this process until the end of the linked list is reached.
6. Return the next node of the dummy node as the head of the modified linked list.

### Solution Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    def mergeNodes(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0)  
        current = dummy  
        sum = 0  
        head = head.next  

        while head:
            if head.val == 0:
                if sum != 0: 
                    current.next = ListNode(sum)
                    current = current.next  
                    sum = 0  
            else:
                sum += head.val
            head = head.next 

        return dummy.next
