# Climbing Stairs

## Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `n = 2`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** There are two ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

#### Example 2

**Input:** `n = 3`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** There are three ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to store the number of ways to reach each step in an array and build up the solution step by step.

### Approach

1. If `n` is 1, there's only one way to climb the stairs (1 step).
2. If `n` is 2, there are two ways to climb the stairs (1 step + 1 step or 2 steps).
3. For `n > 2`, the number of ways to reach the nth step is the sum of the ways to reach the (n-1)th step and the (n-2)th step because you can reach the nth step by taking a single step from the (n-1)th step or by taking two steps from the (n-2)th step.

This can be expressed as:
```
ways[n] = ways[n-1] + ways[n-2]
```

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def climbStairs(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        elif n == 2:
            return 2
        
        ways = [0] * (n + 1)
        ways[1] = 1
        ways[2] = 2
        
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            ways[i] = ways[i - 1] + ways[i - 2]
        
        return ways[n]
```

### Explanation

- We first handle the base cases where `n` is 1 or 2.
- We then initialize an array `ways` to store the number of ways to reach each step. We set `ways[1]` to 1 and `ways[2]` to 2.
- We iterate from step 3 to step `n`, and for each step `i`, we calculate `ways[i]` as the sum of `ways[i-1]` and `ways[i-2]`.
- Finally, we return `ways[n]` which gives us the number of distinct ways to climb to the top of the staircase with `n` steps.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because we only need to calculate the number of ways to reach each step once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we are using an array of size `n+1` to store the number of ways to reach each step.
