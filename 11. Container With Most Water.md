
# Container With Most Water

## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`. Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.

### Examples

#### Example 1

**Input:** `height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`  
**Output:** `49`  
**Explanation:** The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is `49`.

#### Example 2

**Input:** `height = [1,1]`  
**Output:** `1`

## Solution

To solve this problem, we use a two-pointer approach. We initialize two pointers, one at the beginning and one at the end of the array, and calculate the area formed by the lines at these positions. We then move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward, in an attempt to find a taller line that might increase the area.

### Approach

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` at the beginning (index 0) and `j` at the end (index `n-1`) of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `Max_Area` to keep track of the maximum area found so far.
3. While `i` is less than `j`:
   - Calculate the height `H` of the container as the minimum of `height[i]` and `height[j]`.
   - Calculate the width `W` of the container as the difference between `j` and `i`.
   - Calculate the area `Area` as `H * W`.
   - Update `Max_Area` with the maximum of `Max_Area` and `Area`.
   - Move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward. If `height[i]` is less than `height[j]`, increment `i`. Otherwise, decrement `j`.
4. Return `Max_Area` as the maximum amount of water the container can store.

### Code

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        i = 0
        j = len(height) - 1
        Max_Area = 0

        while i < j:
            H = min(height[i], height[j])
            W = j - i
            Area = H * W
            Max_Area = max(Max_Area, Area)

            if height[i] < height[j]:
                i += 1
            else:
                j -= 1
        
        return Max_Area

# Example usage
Obj = Solution()
l = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(Obj.maxArea(l))
```

### Explanation

- We initialize `i` to 0 and `j` to the last index of the `height` array.
- In a loop that runs until `i` is less than `j`, we calculate the current area formed by the lines at positions `i` and `j`.
- We update `Max_Area` if the current area is larger than the previously recorded maximum area.
- We move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward in hopes of finding a taller line that might form a larger area.
- Finally, we return `Max_Area` as the maximum amount of water the container can store.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) because we traverse the array once with two pointers.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space.
