# 1390 Lucky Numbers in a Matrix


## Problem Statement

Given an m x n matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

### Example 1

**Input:** matrix = `[[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]`

**Output:** `[15]`

**Explanation:** 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.

### Example 2

**Input:** matrix = `[[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]`

**Output:** `[12]`

**Explanation:** 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.

### Example 3

**Input:** matrix = `[[7,8],[1,2]]`

**Output:** `[7]`

**Explanation:** 7 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.

## Solution

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def luckyNumbers(self, matrix: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        m = len(matrix)
        n = len(matrix[0])
        lucky_numbers = []

        row_min = []
        def minrow(matrix):
            for row in matrix:
                row_min.append(min(row))
            return row_min
        
        def maxcol(matrix):
            col_max = [matrix[0][j] for j in range(n)]
            for j in range(n):
                for i in range(m):
                    if matrix[i][j] > col_max[j]:
                        col_max[j] = matrix[i][j]
            return col_max

        row_min = minrow(matrix)
        col_max = maxcol(matrix)

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if matrix[i][j] == row_min[i] and matrix[i][j] == col_max[j]:
                    lucky_numbers.append(matrix[i][j])
            
        return lucky_numbers
