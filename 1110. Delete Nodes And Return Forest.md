# 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest

## Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value.

After deleting all nodes with a value in `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees).

Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

### Example 1

**Input**: 
```
root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3,5]
```
**Output**: 
```
[[1,2,null,4],[6],[7]]
```

### Example 2

**Input**: 
```
root = [1,2,4,null,3], to_delete = [3]
```
**Output**: 
```
[[1,2,4]]
```

## Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right

class Solution:
    def delNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], to_delete: List[int]) -> List[TreeNode]:
        to_delete_set = set(to_delete)
        forest = []
        
        def dfs(node, is_root):
            if not node:
                return None
            
            root_deleted = node.val in to_delete_set
            if is_root and not root_deleted:
                forest.append(node)
            
            node.left = dfs(node.left, root_deleted)
            node.right = dfs(node.right, root_deleted)
            
            return None if root_deleted else node
        
        dfs(root, True)
        return forest
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Convert `to_delete` list to a set for efficient lookups.
2. **DFS Function**:
   - **Parameters**: The node being processed and a boolean `is_root` indicating if it's a root of a new tree.
   - **Base Case**: If the node is `None`, return `None`.
   - **Check Deletion**: If the node's value is in `to_delete_set`, mark it as `root_deleted`.
   - **Add to Forest**: If the node is a root and not deleted, add it to the `forest` list.
   - **Recurse**: Recursively call `dfs` for the left and right children. Pass `root_deleted` to children to make them potential new roots if the current node is deleted.
   - **Return**: Return `None` if the node is deleted; otherwise, return the node itself.
3. **Call DFS on Root**: Start the DFS traversal from the root with `is_root` set to `True`.
4. **Return Forest**: The list `forest` now contains the roots of all the trees in the remaining forest.
