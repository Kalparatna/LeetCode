## Problem Description

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:
* Insert a character
* Delete a character
* Replace a character

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

## Solution

The problem is solved using dynamic programming. We create a 2D table where each cell `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`.

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m = len(word1)
        n= len(word2)

        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

        for i in range(m + 1):
            dp[i][0] = i
        for j in range(n + 1):
            dp[0][j] = j

        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j],    # Delete
                                       dp[i][j-1],    # Insert
                                       dp[i-1][j-1])  # Replace

        return dp[m][n]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(m*n), where m and n are the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively.
- Space Complexity: O(m*n) for the DP table.

## How It Works

1. We create a 2D DP table initialized with zeros.
2. We fill the first row and column with increasing numbers to represent the operations needed to convert to an empty string or from an empty string.
3. We iterate through the table, filling each cell based on whether the current characters match and the minimum operations from previous states.
4. The final cell `dp[m][n]` gives the minimum number of operations needed to convert the entire `word1` to `word2`.

This solution efficiently solves the problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems and using their solutions to build up the solution for the entire problem.
