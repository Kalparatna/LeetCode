# 1605. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums

## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the ith row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements of the jth column of a 2D matrix. In other words, you do not know the elements of the matrix, but you do know the sums of each row and column.

Find any matrix of non-negative integers of size `rowSum.length x colSum.length` that satisfies the rowSum and colSum requirements.

Return a 2D array representing any matrix that fulfills the requirements. It's guaranteed that at least one matrix that fulfills the requirements exists.

### Example 1:

**Input:**
```plaintext
rowSum = [3,8]
colSum = [4,7]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[[3,0],
 [1,7]]
```

**Explanation:**
```plaintext
0th row: 3 + 0 = 3 == rowSum[0]
1st row: 1 + 7 = 8 == rowSum[1]
0th column: 3 + 1 = 4 == colSum[0]
1st column: 0 + 7 = 7 == colSum[1]
The row and column sums match, and all matrix elements are non-negative.
Another possible matrix is: [[1,2],
                             [3,5]]
```

### Example 2:

**Input:**
```plaintext
rowSum = [5,7,10]
colSum = [8,6,8]
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[[0,5,0],
 [6,1,0],
 [2,0,8]]
```

## Solution

The goal is to construct a matrix that satisfies the given row and column sums. We can use a greedy approach to fill the matrix, ensuring that at each step we do not exceed the required sums.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty matrix with all elements set to zero.
2. Iterate over the rows and columns.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`, set `matrix[i][j]` to the minimum of the remaining row sum and column sum.
4. Update the remaining sums accordingly.
5. Return the constructed matrix.

### Python Code:
```python
class Solution:
    def restoreMatrix(self, rowSum: List[int], colSum: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        m, n = len(rowSum), len(colSum)
        # Initialize each cell to zero
        matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]

        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                matrix[i][j] = min(rowSum[i], colSum[j])
                rowSum[i] -= matrix[i][j]
                colSum[j] -= matrix[i][j]
        
        return matrix
```

### Explanation:
- **Initialization**:
  - The matrix is initialized to all zeros.
  - `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns.

- **Filling the Matrix**:
  - For each cell `(i, j)`, the value is set to the minimum of the remaining row sum `rowSum[i]` and column sum `colSum[j]`.
  - This ensures that the value does not exceed the required sum for either the row or the column.
  - The corresponding sums are updated by subtracting the value placed in the matrix.
