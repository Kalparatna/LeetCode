# 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings

## Problem Description

You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

1. Remove the substring "ab" and gain `x` points.
   - For example, removing "ab" from "cabxbae" results in "cxbae".

2. Remove the substring "ba" and gain `y` points.
   - For example, removing "ba" from "cabxbae" results in "cabxe".

Return the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on `s`.

### Example 1:

**Input**: 

s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5

**Output**: 

**Explanation**:
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, `s = "cdbcbbaaab"` and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, `s = "cdbcbbaa"` and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, `s = "cdbcba"` and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, `s = "cdbc"` and 5 points are added to the score.
- Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

### Example 2:

**Input**: 
s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4


**Output**: 
20



## Solution

Here is the solution code for the problem:

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGain(self, s: str, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        def pair_remove(s, first, second, points):
            stack = []
            total_points = 0
            for i in s:
                if stack and stack[-1] == first and i == second:
                    stack.pop()
                    total_points += points
                else:
                    stack.append(i)
            return ''.join(stack), total_points
        
        if x > y:
            s, score1 = pair_remove(s, 'a', 'b', x)
            s, score2 = pair_remove(s, 'b', 'a', y)
        else:
            s, score2 = pair_remove(s, 'b', 'a', y)
            s, score1 = pair_remove(s, 'a', 'b', x)
        
        return score1 + score2

```
